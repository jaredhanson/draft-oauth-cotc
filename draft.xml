      <t>
        This document describes a mechanism that allows an HTTP service to
        confirm the binding of a security token to a user agent.
      </t>
      <t>
        Such binding is useful in federated scenarios.  An identity provider may
        send an IdP-initiated login request to a relying party by transmitting
        a security token identifying the user to be logged in via HTTP
        redirection.  When the identity provider and relying party are on
        separate domains, it is impossible to bind the security token to a
        session using HTTP state management mechanisms such as cookies.  A
        token left unbound in this manner can be used exfiltrated from the user
        agent to which is was issued, and replayed in a different user agent,
        leaving such flows vulnerable to cross-site request forgery.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines a mechanism to bind a security token to the
        web origin from which it was issued, and subsequently confirm with the
        issuing web origin that the security token is being presented to an HTTP
        service from the same user agent to which it was issued.
