               OAuth 2.0 Cross-Origin Token Confirmation
                     draft-hanson-oauth-cotc-latest

Abstract

   This specification describes how to declare in a JWT that the
   presenter of a JWT is a User Agent through which a verifier can be
   obtained.  It further specifies how the reciever can obtain the
   verifier and confirm that the User Agent is authorized to present the
   security token.  Confirmation in this manner protects these tokens
   from token export attacks.

Internet-Draft  OAuth 2.0 Cross-Origin Token Confirmation     April 2017


1.  Introduction

   This specification describes how to declare in a JWT that the
   presenter of a JWT is a User Agent through which a verifier can be
   obtained.  It further specifies how the reciever can obtain the
   verifier and confirm that the User Agent is authorized to present the
   security token.  Confirmation in this manner protects these tokens
   from token export attacks.

   Token confirmation improves security in federated scenarios, and in
   particular federated scenarios that start at the Identity Provider.
   In an IdP-initiated Federated Sign-On protocol, an Identity Provider
   issues an identity token to a User Agent, which sends the identity
   token to a Relying Party to authenticate itself.  Examples of this
   include OpenID Connect (where the identity token is called "ID
   Token") and SAML (where the identity token is a SAML assertion).

   In such an IdP-initiated flow, the identity token is a bearer token
   and can be used by any User Agent in posession of the token.  Bearer
   tokens can be exported from the User Agent and replayed in a
   different User Agent, leaving such flows vulnerable to cross-site
   request forgery.

   This specification allows the issuer of a security token to indicate
   that a verifier is obtainable via the User Agent to which the token
   was issued.  The Relying Party can confirm this verifier via the User
   Agent, thereby protecting against token export attacks.

2.  Cross-Origin Token Confirmation Representation

   This specification defines the new JWT Confirmation Method [RFC7800]
   member cov (cross-origin verifier) and coi (cross-origin verifier
   ID).  The value of the cov member is the verifier that MUST be
   obtained via the User Agent for the token to be confirmed.  The value
   of the coi member is an identifer for the verifier, and allows
   identification of a specific verifier in scenarios where multiple
   verifiers are in use.

   The following example demonstrates the JWT Claims Set of an ID Token
   containing a verifier as the value of the cov (cross-origin verifier)
   element in the cnf (confirmation) claim:

   {
      "iss": "https://server.example.com",
      "sub": "0f6LkoE3KsPyxQ",
      "aud": "0d8f597e-bc45-46b2-97cf-043c88aa5ecc",
