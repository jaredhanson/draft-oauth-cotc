Internet-Draft  OAuth 2.0 Cross-Origin Token Confirmation     April 2017


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a mechanism that allows an HTTP service to
   confirm the binding of a security token to a user agent.

   Such binding is useful in federated scenarios.  An identity provider
   may send an IdP-initiated login request to a relying party by
   transmitting a security token identifying the user to be logged in
   via HTTP redirection.  When the identity provider and relying party
   are on separate domains, it is impossible to bind the security token
   to a session using HTTP state management mechanisms such as cookies.
   A token left unbound in this manner can be used exfiltrated from the
   user agent to which is was issued, and replayed in a different user
   agent, leaving such flows vulnerable to cross-site request forgery.

   This specification defines a mechanism to bind a security token to
   the web origin from which it was issued, and subsequently confirm
   with the issuing web origin that the security token is being
   presented to an HTTP service from the same user agent to which it was
   issued.
